Revision history for Perl extension Math::Symbolic::Custom::CCompiler.

1.00  Sat Jul 30 21:43:42 2005
	- Changed call to _find_vars in the ::Compiler package to a method call
	  to explicit_signature() which does basically the same thing. Reason
	  is, that I've done this to ::Compiler a while ago an removed
	  _find_vars. So no I've learned why you don't just call private
	  routines of another package!
